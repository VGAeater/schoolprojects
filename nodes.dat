It is a stormy, dark day, with thunder and lightning blasting all around you. Lightning strikes, illuminating the house and hitting a tree. The person decides to go inside and risk it in this haunted house. Once inside, there is a door on the left and the right. Type 1 for left, 2 for right.
1   0   0  81They instantly drop dead, not even realizing it themself. End of story! YAYYYYYY!
0   3   4 353They walk through, seeing various items like ghosts, goblins, and more. Eventually, they make it to a room, it looks like a kitchen. Cobwebs litter the room, and a flickering, light barely illuminates the room. There is an old, rusted table with a laptop and knife on it. Because I said so, you can only pick one. Type 1 for the knife, 2 for the laptop.
0   5   6 127Cool. Its rusted with a matte black handle, but might still help just in case. Put it in your pocket? Type 1 for yes, 2 for no.
0   9  10 275You grab it, it looks strangely like the one of Stratton Jelley. You decide to walk to the next hallway. Its even more dark than before. Theres a door with a hand on the window, and an open door to the field outside. Type 1 to go towards the field, 2 to head toward the door.
1   0   0  64You move your hand, but it slips out of your grip and...you die!
0   7   8 206You walk toward the other side of the room. There is an old chest, with a lock. However, the chestâ€™s top is expanded from all the items in it. You can easily pry it open. Do you? Type 1 for yes, 2 for no.
1   0   0  82A bunch of objects come flying out, hitting you straight in the head, and you die.
1   0   0 102After deciding to not risk it, you take a step back to continue and slip on a puddle. Whoops, you die!
0  11  12 265Its damp, the storm has picked up even more. All of a sudden, somethings behind you, and coming fast. You need to go, NOW. The way out is blocked by a corn maze, you can either cut through or go through normally. Type 1 for going through, and 2 for cutting through.
0  13  14 317The room is dark, the only thing you can see is a lightswitch. You turn it on. There's a group of zombies straight in front of you, looking well... like this wont go well. They are blocking a door, that is the only way through. You can either try to charge through or wait. Type 1 for charging through, 2 for waiting.
1   0   0 222You take off running, cutting past corners as fast as the wind. You seem to run forever, but you eventually get near the exit and... lightning flashes, spooking you and making you trip. Its too late... it caught up to you.
1   0   0 142You start speeding through corn, it hitting you everywhere, but your still going. All of a sudden, you trip on a rake and there goes your leg!
1   0   0 268Well, what did you think would happen charging through 10 zombies? Did you honestly think you were built different. That was the most braindead idea I have ever heard. Okay, you get through two before they swarm you and knock you to the ground. That was dumb. You die.
0  15  16 232They seem to be uninterested, moving around a bit, revealing the door to be the way out. This is it. You can escape!!!! You can either use your laptop as a bat and run, or turn around. Type 1 to use the laptop, and 2 to turn around.
1   0   0 283You take a deep breath and charge, swinging your laptop around. Its heavy weight serves a good purpose for once. One goes down, then another and another. This might be it!  You get through all of them, pushing the door open to freedom and running off, as fast as you can possibly go.
1   0   0 215You turn around, and all you see is another group of zombies chasing you. You drop the laptop out of fear, and the zombies seem to get incredibly angry over that. I dont want to write what happens next, but you die!
